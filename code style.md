# Current naming conventions (subject to debate)

## Function names

### header functions

function should start by the name of their module in camelCase followed by an underscore and the name of the function in camelCase

example:
    steam_searchGames()

if the function has the same name as the module then it doesn't need to be repeated.

### static functions

all static functions should be in camelCase and they should not mention their module.

## Struct names

function should start by the name of their module in camelCase followed by an underscore and the name of the struct in PascalCase
